Description
The application allows a user to key in the values  of the lengths of  the three sides of whatever  triangle they wish to test in the application.
Once their values are keyed in, the application will indicate the type of triangle  values will produce, through dispalying whether it is  an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.
In order for a user to to get an equilateral triangle as the answer, all sides of the triangle must be equal.
In order for the answer to be displayed as an isosceles triangle, two sides are required to be equal.
In the case of a  scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal.
A triangle cannot be formed, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side.

Setup/Installation Requirements
THe user first has to input the length values of the triangle and after submitting them to the application, it will run and give an output of the type of triangle it is either an equilateral, isoscceles, scalene trangle or not a triangle at all.It is user friendly and pretty straight forward.
